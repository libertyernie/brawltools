	. Fixed bug where saving a file with unmodified compressed children would result in the file being corrupted

Hotfix 1 (2/20/2015):
	. Fixed bug where an extra bone named TopN would be added to the imported bone tree (this is only supposed to be added to models with no bones)

Initial Release (2/19/2015):

	. Fixed bug where PMD models could no longer be imported
	. Fixed bug where the vertex editor did not appear in the model viewer when using the "J" hotkey
	. Removed MDL0 material light channel count and instead added "enabled" to each light channel's properties
	. Renamed MDL0 material "ZCompareLoc" property to "CompareBeforeTexture" and added it under "Z Mode".
	. Fixed bug where MDL0 textures that aren't used by any object were written to the model (metal00 for Brawl models).
	. Added TPL, EFLS, REFF and REFT as nodes that can be created from scratch
	. Fixed bug where billboard bones did not apply in the model panel
	. Added option to zoom precisely in the model viewer by pressing the middle mouse button and dragging

	. Added tool to search for animations at the top of the animation list in the model viewer
	. Added option to MDL0 right click menu to recalculate and set bounding boxes at bind state (model and visibility bone boxes)
	. Added options to render visibility bone boxes, model boxes, and object boxes separately under View->Model->'Bounding Boxes' in the model viewer

 - v0.74- (12/25/2014) - BrawlLib v0.21
	. Brawlbox can now check for updates on startup (can be enabled via Tools->Settings) or when you go to Help->"Check for updates" and automatically install that update for you, in another folder or in place of the current version.
	. Support for adding new collision nodes to ARC via right click.
	. Support for adding new BLOC to ARC via right click.
	. Support for editing and adding the following nodes found in BLOC archives:
		- GSND sound files
		- ADSJ StepJump files, required to link rooms and levels.
		- GDOR Adventure door files, requires rooms linked via ADSJ.
	. Support for item frequency nodes.
	. BrawlBox now displays redirected nodes with their own icon
	. Fixed setting redirect index.
	. Fixed embedded module files (common2 and common3) not parsing.
	. Fixed BBox crashing when no vertices exist in Target model.
	. Fixed alignment of the frame indicator with the mouse when dragging it in the interpolation editor.

	. Fixed always asking to save after opening the collision editor, regardless if things were changed.
	. Fixed IA8 texture bug where alpha and intensity were swapped
	. Fixed frame counts on looped animations with keyframes (CHR0, SRT0, SHP0, SCN0): there is an extra loop frame at the end
	. Added proper texture matrix support that uses the Texture Matrix Mode included in SRT0, MDL0 and MDL0 material properties.
	. Fixed bug where if two keyframes were on the same frame, the second overwrote the first. Now, for example, Game&Watch's animations now display properly.
	. Fixed several SCN0 rebuilding bugs including when changing the frame count or using animated color arrays would cause the file to save improperly
	. Fixed Collada importer bug that occured when mesh nodes were nested inside another. Their bind matrices were not multiplied with the previous node, causing the imported object's mesh to be out of place.
	. Fixed Collada importer bug that occured when the imported model had no normals.
	. Fixed Collada importer bug that occured when the imported model had some rigged and some unrigged objects. Unrigged objects are now rigged to the first bone.
	. Fixed bug where opening environment settings would radically enlarge various rendered items. (bone controls, overlays, etc.)
	. Changing tool via options->viewer->bone control or shortcuts E,R, and T now updates Tool dropdown and vice versa.
	. Model editor now displays bones that are not part of the currently selected model at half opacity, and in a red color.
	. Section editor now displays number of selected bytes, rather than length of the full section. (bottom status bar)
	. GCT editor saves unchecked codes as disabled in .txt (pads the left side with an asterisk). Saving as GCT will not save disabled codes
	. GCT editor now allows multiline descriptions in .txt files.
	. Improved pixel format conversion, furthering its acuracy. (see details here: https://github.com/libertyernie/brawltools/pull/14)
	. Fixed scaling of bone control in the model previewer when changing the "Y Field Of View" in the environment settings window under Menu->Options
	. Added experimental support for orthographic projection in the viewport. Toggleable under Menu->Options->Environment Settings->Orthographic. 
		Note: there are problems with this, such as billboard bones and the scaling of the bone edit control. Orthographic cameras look AT their origin point, while perspective cameras look OUT from their origin point.
	. Added a live texture folder to the model previewer. Select a folder under Menu->Tools->"Live Texture Folder" and any textures with names that match the model's textures will be auto-loaded on the model when modified.
	. Added a small dialog in the collision editor to rotate/translate/scale selected planes by specific values.
	. Object / Method editor has been added to the module editor pending a better UI for it.
		- Right click on methods allows you to open the Method's Assembly in section editor.
		- Right click on inheritance items will open the section editor to THAT INSTANCE'S declaration, before the object's vTable.
		- PPC disassembler now stops at branch commands in addition to blr.
		- Added a button to the disassembler that is only visible when a branch command is selected, allowing you to jump to that location.
	. Better support for MDL0 billboard bones. Can now render properly in the viewer and be properly set in the bone's properties.
	. Added the option to view property descriptions if they are available (Can be enabled in Tools->Settings). Most currently available descriptions are located in the properties of nodes found in MDL0 (materials, shaders, bones, etc).
	. Added property descriptions to some MDL0 material and bone properties. More descriptions coming soon.
	. Added a texture coordinate viewer when selecting MDL0 material reference nodes and MDL0 texture nodes. Options to display only certain coords and export as a texture coming soon.

 - v0.73b- (8/14/2014) - BrawlLib v0.20b
	. Model previewer now has the abiility to render the stage boundries as well as respawn and spawn areas
